GBA game involving knocking out wrestlers before time runs out!

The object of the game is to fight a bunch of constantly moving opponent wrestlers as a player. Once contact is made with them in their weak spot with your strong spot (ie the top left corners of both objects are close to each other),
you gain a point via knockout. In order to win, the player must knock out every single opponent wrestler. 
However, there is a 30 second timer, and if by the end of the timer, the player has not knocked out all the opponents, the player loses.

Controls:

DOWN: DOWN ARROW (moves player down)
RIGHT: RIGHT ARROW (moves player to the right)
LEFT: LEFT ARROW (moves player to the left)
